            <p>Every year, I run an online Secret Santa with my friends where we <em>make gifts for each other instead of buying them</em>. I always look forward to getting these handmade, personalised gifts.</p>
            <p>Let’s try this with Hack Club!</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Sign up for Giftbox by 8 Dec.</li>
                <li>Receive a gift recipient on 10 Dec. We’ll try to match your interests and likes. </li>
                <li><em>Make</em> something fun that they might like — a website, a tool, a game, an interactive story. You’re not allowed to buy anything!</li>
                <li>Submit your gift by 25 Dec — and get a gift from someone else!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>(& get a transparent sticker for submitting 🥳)</p>

                <p>You can make any kind of project that is <em>shipped</em> — something that others can experience easily on the internet.

                <p>Hardware projects are not allowed.</p>

                <summary>What if I sign up and realise that I don't want to make a gift later?</summary>
                <p>Giftbox trusts you to make one — if you don't, someone won't get a gift, and it'll be really sad! We ask that you truly commit to this event — it'll only take an hour or two to make someone's day :)</p>
                <p>If you truly do not want to make something, please reach out to me as soon as possible.</p>
                <p>I'm also free anytime if you need help figuring out what to make or deploying your project so that everyone can receive one.</p>
